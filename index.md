I'm David Vargas, a young research economist and coffee nerd, like most Colombians.
Currently, I work as a Research Fellow at the Inter-American Development Bank Research Department.  Previously I worked at the World Bank, Universidad del Rosario Department of Economics and the Central Bank of Colombia. I hold an M.A. in economics from Universidad del Rosario and a B.A. in Economics from Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Feel free to reach me at [davidvar@iadb.org](mailto:davidvar@iadb.org)

My research interest focuses on Development Economics, Poverty & inequality, Environmental Economics and Political Economy.
